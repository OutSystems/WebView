Avalonia/WPF control that wraps CefGlue webview control

![Screenshot](./SampleWebView.Avalonia/screenshot.png)

WebView lets you embed Chromium in .NET apps. It is a .NET wrapper control around [CefGlue](https://github.com/OutSystems/CefGlue) and provides a better and simple API. Likewise CefGlue it can be used from C# or any other CLR language and provides both Avalonia and WPF web browser control implementations. The Avalonia implementation runs on Windows and macOS. Linux is not supported yet.

It also provides the following additional features:
- Strongly-typed javascript evaluation: results of javascript evaluation returns the appropriate type
- Scripts are aggregated and executed in bulk for improved performance
- Ability to evaluate javascript synchronously
- Javascript error handling with call stack information
- Events to intercept and respond to resources loading
- Events to track file download progress
- Ability to load embedded resources using custom protocols
- Ability to disable history navigation
- Error handling
- Proxy configuration support
- Option to run in [offscreen rendering mode](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/GeneralUsage#markdown-header-off-screen-rendering) (not recommended as it has several issues)

## Releases
Stable binaries are released on NuGet, and contain everything you need to embed Chromium in your .NET/CLR application.
